# BANEL HAS MERGED WITH TOVY!! https://discord.gg/pTm5mGtZ2G

# banPanel
a website-roblox ban panel to ban users, view current ingame users, and more!

this is not fully done yet, there is still some stuff coming. all the main functionality is there though.

features: 
- nice interface that is visible in the web browser
- you can ban a user online that is currently in game and they will be kicked in seconds!
- low resources are needed, making it reasonable to host on railway or repl.it
- an API that can be used to integrate the ban system into admin commands, or a discord bot
- a slick verification API that is not used on the site, but can be used in a bot or another application
- a rock-hard, secure permission system that completely relys on discord roles. the only known way to bypass this is to dive into the server code itself
- a neat way to view all the current players in your game, as well as ban them
- a cool developer that has nothing better to do, so there will be constant updates

coming soon:
- an automatic updating system, accessible via the settings menu
- settings menu
- timed bans
